            <h1>The Mali: Bujbiha Records</h1>
            <h3>The collection</h3>
            <p>
                The Bujbiha/Boujbeiha/بوجبهي Library is in a fairly remote
                settlement located about 90 km. southeast of Araouane, Mali in
                the eastern Azawad, at the meeting point of two culture zones:
                the Hassaniyya-speaking western Sahara and the
                Tamashegh-speaking central Sahara that shared a clerical
                tradition in a Bedouin setting. For this reason, its’ contents
                may be of especial interest. The al-Zeiniyyah library there was
                inventoried by and published in a catalogue for the al-Furqan
                Islamic Heritage Foundation in 2006 that was prepared by `Abd
                al-Qadir Mamma Haidarah and edited by Ayman Fuad Sayyid. The
                catalogue lists 998 works; of 520 them by authors who have
                previously been entered in WAAMD, 130 by new authors (many,
                alas, with incomplete names) and 280 by unknown authors. This is
                one of the most thoroughly documented of the al-Furqan
                catalogues entered in WAAMD and researchers are advised to
                consult the print catalogue for additional information about
                manuscripts which has not been extracted in this abbreviated
                listing. For further detail on the intellectual world reflected
                in this inventory, see H.T. Norris’s,{' '}

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The contents of the Bujbiha Library are typical of other
                ‘teaching libraries’ in WAAMD which tend to be family
                collections built up over a number of generations and are
                valuable for the insights they provide in their teaching
                materials. In addition to a window into the resources of the
                Bujbiha clan, it contains work by well-known scholars from the
                Kalsῡk/Kel Es-Suq/Sῡqiyyῡn which are not found elsewhere in the
                WAAMD. Protocols followed by the al-Furqan Foundation
                distinguish between manuscripts and ‘documents’ (correspondence,
                short devotional tracts, and other items not strictly classified
                as writing in the Islamic sciences); this inventory is confined
                to manuscripts in the Islamic disciplines.
            </p>

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                To the best of our knowledge this library remains in place where
                the manuscripts are open to researchers.
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                WAAMD references refer to catalogue numbers in the al-Furqan
                inventory (which, it should be noted, lack records for #288 and
                #933, which explains the total count of 1000 records as being,
                in fact, 998).
            </p>

            <h3>Subjects</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections. The al-Furqan assignment of subjects
                conforms to a similar system and have only occasionally been
                described in more detail in these notices than in the original
                catalogue (following information gleaned from the work’s title)
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
