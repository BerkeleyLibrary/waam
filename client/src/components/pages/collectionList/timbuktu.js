            <h3>The collection</h3>
            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the Timbuktu IHERIAB collection
                were recorded in the WAAMD in 1990/91 from a photographed copy
                of the hand-list maintained at the Centre de Documentation et de
                Recherches Historiques Ahmad Baba (CEDRAB) in Timbuktu, [today
                the Institut des Hautes Etudes et de Recherche Islamique Ahmad
                Baba, IHERIAB] made available for this project by the then
                director Mahmoud Zoubair. At that time 5640 manuscripts had been
                recorded at CEDRAB, a compilation of locally gathered materials
                that has since grown to over 16,000 holdings. The Al- Furqan
                Islamic Heritage Foundation began printing a series of
                catalogues for CEDRAB in 1995 with greater detail to individual
                manuscripts than was possible in the hand-list, and although the
                numeration of the first 5640 items in WAAMD roughly correspond
                to the printed volumes, there is some discrepancy and These are:
                Vol. I (ed. Sidi Amar Ould Ely, 1995) records 1- 1500; Vol. II
                (ed. ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbas, 1996) records 1501-2999; Vol. III
                (ed. ‘Abd al- Muhsin al-‘Abbas, 1997) records 3001-4500; Vol. IV
                (ed. ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbas, 1998) records 4501-6000; Vol V
                (1998), records 6001-9000. researchers will need to confirm the
                record numbers for the Timbuctu collection that are cited in
                WAAMD entries with the official published volumes.
            </p>
            <p>These are:</p>
            <p>
                Vol. I (ed. Sidi Amar Ould Ely, 1995) records 1- 1500;
                <br />
                Vol. II (ed. ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbas, 1996) records 1501-2999;
                <br />
                Vol. III (ed. ‘Abd al- Muhsin al-‘Abbas, 1997) records
                3001-4500;
                <br />
                Vol. IV (ed. ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbas, 1998) records 4501-6000;
                <br />
                Vol V (1998), records 6001-9000.

                Correlation between the order in which manuscripts are listed in
                these catalogues and the WAAMD numeration is not always exact.
                The correspondence between WAAMD entries and the published
                catalogues is as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                Volume I of the al-Furqan series lists entries in a numerical
                order and inserts the actual collection numbers in (brackets);
                these bracketed collection numbers correspond to the numeration
                of the first 1500 items in WAAMD.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Volume II there is exact coordination between manuscript
                numeration and the WAAMD entries up to published catalogue entry
                2672. Between it and # 2900 there is a discordance that is
                resolved by published entry # 3000 (which appears in WAAMD as #
                3002 in the ‘Timbuktu IHERIAB’ collection).
            </p>
            <p>
                Volume III continues in exact coordination with the WAAMD
                entries but for a two-entry discordance noted above, and at
                entry #4467 both systems are again entirely synchronized.
            </p>
            <p>
                Volume IV numeration and that of the WAAMD entries continue to
                be synchronized up to entry #5561 (the point where the CAB
                collection concluded in 1991) and the WAAMD entries now
                conclude.
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The Timbuktu collection was built from various individual
                collections in Northern Mali beginning in the late 1970s. Among
                the most important local libraries that were incorporated into
                the CEDRAB collection was that of Ahmad Bul-Araf, a Timbuktu
                bibliophile of Moroccan ancestry. By the early 1990s, CEDRAB had
                become the major Arabic manuscript repository in West Africa,
                recipient of UNESCO and Al-Furqan funding and with facilities
                for researchers and manuscript preservation that are
                unparalleled across the Sahel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its early accessions reflect the bias found in other national
                repositories toward classical works and major local authors,
                although more recent acquisitions (as reflected in the published
                catalogues) include a large amount of correspondence and lesser
                works, more reflective of the locally- produced literary record
                of the region. The WAAMD records have not been enhanced with the
                additional data that appear in some of the published catalogues,
                and it must therefore be used as a rough, and partial, guide to
                the early IHERIAB collections. Plans are afoot to update this
                hand- list data with manuscript accessions since the early
                1990s.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                The IHERIAB collection is open to researchers in Timbuktu, Mali.
                Officially, researchers require authorization from the Malian
                government to conduct research in the country. Application for
                research authorization should be directed to IHERIAB.

            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Serial entries of items appear as the record number for WAAMD;
                citations to the actual hand-list numbers in the IHERIAB
                collection (as they appeared in 1990) are under “collection
                number” in the individual records. The numeration of the first
                5640 items roughly correspond to the printed volumes cited
                above, but there is some discrepancy (see above) and researchers
                will need to confirm the record numbers for the Timbuktu
                collection with the official published volumes (I-IV).
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The range of subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort
                to uniformly apply the subject headings developed for the
                Boutilimit and Nouakchott collections, but in some of the
                IHERIAB entries (working from their hand- lists rather than the
                better-documented, published volumes now available) the subject
                headings were reconstructed from titles where these were
                available. These subject rubrics are neither comprehensive nor
                definitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject classifications will make sense to a student of the
                Islamic sciences and are consistent across English and Arabic
                entries, but in a few cases there may be slight variance.
                Correspondence presents special problems that were solved, where
                the content was discernable from a title, by grouping letters
                into three broad, not unambiguous rubrics: ‘politics’, ‘economy’
                and ‘society’.

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail is collected about individual works this process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One result of
                this process is that some names in the database may vary from
                their original cataloguing. Where changes have been made every
                effort has been made to retain elements of the original
                citations, and, when in doubt, to repeat local variants of
                author names. If author attribution has been changed, the
                original citation from cataloguers in the field has been
                retained in the miscellaneous field for the record.
