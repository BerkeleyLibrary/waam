            <p>
                Records from the Cheickna Boulker Library in Timbuktu (“Timbuktu
                CBO”) have been provided by The Centre for the Study of
                Manuscript Cultures (CSMC), University of Hamburg, in
                collaboration with a consortium of private libraries, Sauvegarde
                et Valorisation des Manuscrits pour la Défense de la Culture
                Islamique, in Timbuktu, Mali, (SAVAMA-DCI) and the Hill Museum
                and Manuscript Library (HMML), St. John’s University, St. Cloud
                Minnesota. HMML is digitizing manuscripts transferred from
                Timbuktu to Bamako in 2013, and this is the third of those 22
                private libraries in Timbuktu to be entered in WAAMD.{' '}

            <p>
                <strong>The Cheickna Boulker Library</strong> consists of 1500
                items. SAVAMA-DCI inventories encompass all written material
                found in the library, providing a thorough accounting of these
                private libraries. This dramatically inflates the number of
                “manuscripts” in collections, since it includes large numbers of
                brief notes by unknown writers. To illustrate: in the
                (non-SAVAMA) Boutilimit library of 2051 records, 10% are by
                unknown authors; in the original (1991) handlist of accessions
                from private libraries that then made up the national collection
                of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu, 17% of the authors were unknown.
                Small, incomplete fragments of works and one and two folio
                devotional pieces by unknown authors were largely ignored in
                cataloguing these collections. By contrast, in{' '}
                <strong>the Cheickna Boulker Library</strong> inventory 85%
                (1275 of the total manuscripts) are by unknown authors. Further,
                87% (1,312) of the works by unknown authors are one or two
                folios in length. This large number of works lacking in
                searchable data points presents a challenge to bibliographers
                and researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                WAAMD records include all items in SAVAMA-DCI inventories that
                exceed two folios in length and/or (irrespective of length) that
                contain at least two of the following: author name, nisba,
                familiar names (“known as”), recipients’ names (mainly in
                correspondence), secondary authors, titles and subject matter. .
                In the <strong>Cheickna Boulker Library</strong>, 206 records
                meet these criteria. For the 1,312 one and two-folio items that
                lack searchable information, researchers are invited to consult
                the original inventory, sorted by attributed titles (generally
                the most descriptive part of their entries) at the link noted{' '}
                <a href="/files/timbuktu-cbo/timbuktu-CBO-1-2-folio-items.xlsx">
                    HERE <i className="fas fa-download" />{' '}
                </a>. As additional, searchable information is gleaned from
                these entries we will be adding them to the WAAMD database.
            </p>
            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The works by identified authors in Timbuktu CBO are not typical
                of the contents of other WAAMD family library records;
                relatively few of the classical authors or their commentators
                are found, and fewer still local authors writing in the Islamic
                sciences. There is, however, a large quantity of correspondence,
                124 pieces in all, many with their author and recipient noted.
                These include over 100 writers whose names are new to WAAMD.
                Unfortunately, we have only partial names for many of the new
                authors, and it appears that the same recipient is addressed
                with varying names, but as more correspondence is added from the
                SAVAMA-DCI project additional information about them may emerge
                and names consolidated. Most of the correspondence concerns
                matters of commerce or social affairs, which suggest that this
                library belonged to a merchant rather than an Islamic scholar.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, links to
                digital copies of individual manuscripts in Timbuktu CBO at the
                HMML Virtual Reading Room will be noted in records when these
                become available. The home HMML site can be reached at
                http://hmml.org/
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations in Timbuktu CBO records refer to the original
                cataloguing numbers that are identical to the HMML digital
                records numbers for each manuscript.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections, but in cases where only a minimal level
                of detail was annotated in the field inventories, subject
                headings have been reconstructed from keywords in titles where
                these are available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries, but there may occasionally be slight variance
                across these fields. The subject matter for correspondence
                presents special problems that were solved, where the content
                was discernable from a title or by the annotator in the field,
                by grouping correspondence into three broad, not unambiguous
                rubrics: politics, economy and society. The other rubric used in
                WAAMD that does not come out of the Islamic disciplines is that
                of “devotional’ ( تحنث ) to encompass the large body of
                Prophetic love literature, invocations, intercession,
                exhortation, prayer, supplication, etc. Most of these also
                appear as sub-headings under Belief, Sufism or Esoteric
                sciences.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original Timbuktu ABO inventory employed a range of subject
                headings not entirely consistent with the other WAAMD records,
                and, where possible, they have been altered to conform to
                existing subject rubrics. As explained in the drop-down “SUBJECT
                HEADINGS,” the same or similar material may appear under more
                than one broad rubric, following the best judgment of different
                catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by nisba, familiar
                names and standard author names. Now, the Library of Congress
                name authority file is being added to WAAMD records, and as more
                detail is collected about individual works and added this
                process of refining and standardizing names will continue. One
                consequence of refining name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. In some
                cases, in the Timbuktu CBO collection, a title clearly was
                misattributed to another author; where author attribution has
                been changed, the original citation from cataloguers in the
                field has been retained in the miscellaneous field for the
                record.
