                Records from the <strong>Imām Alfā Saloum Library</strong> in
                Timbuktu (“Timbuktu ASAL”) have been provided by The Centre for
                the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC), University of Hamburg,

                <strong>The Imām Alfā Saloum Library</strong> inventory lists
                9,897 items. SAVAMA-DCI inventories encompass all written
                material found in the library, providing a thorough accounting
                of these private libraries. This dramatically inflates the
                number of “manuscripts” in collections, since it includes large
                numbers of brief notes by unknown writers. To illustrate: in the
                (non-SAVAMA) Boutilimit library of 2051 records, 10% are by
                unknown authors; in the original (1991) handlist of accessions
                from private libraries that then made up the national collection
                of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu, 17% of the authors were unknown.
                Small, incomplete fragments of works and one and two folio
                devotional pieces by unknown authors were largely ignored in
                cataloguing these collections. By contrast, in{' '}
                <strong>the Imām Alfā Saloum Library</strong> inventory 93%
                (9,242 of the total manuscripts) are by unknown authors.
                Further, 94% (8,643) of the works by unknown authors are one or
                two folios in length. Only 6% (559) of the one and two folio
                items are identified by an author or, in correspondence, by
                their recipient. This large number of works lacking in
                searchable data points presents a challenge to bibliographers
                and researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                WAAMD records include all items in SAVAMA-DCI inventories that
                contain at least three of the following searchable elements:
                author name, author nisba, familiar names (“known as”),
                recipients’ names (mainly in correspondence), secondary authors,
                titles and subject matter, and all items that exceed two folios
                in length. In the <strong>Imām Alfā Saloum Library</strong>,
                1,253 records meet these criteria. For the 8,643 one and
                two-folio items that lack searchable information, researchers
                are invited to consult the original inventory, sorted by
                attributed titles (generally the most descriptive part of their
                entries) at the link noted{' '}
                <a href="/files/timbuktu-asal/Timbuktu-ASAL-1-2-folio.xlsx">
                    HERE <i className="fas fa-download" />{' '}
                </a>. As additional, searchable information is gleaned from
                these entries we will be adding them to the WAAMD database.
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The works by authors from the ‘classical’ canon in the{' '}
                <strong>Imām Alfā Saloum Library</strong> are typical of what is
                found in other SAVAMA-DCI collections. Additionally, there are
                350 authors who are new to WAAMD, 272 of them in one of the
                largest collections of correspondence in the SAVAMA libraries.
                The two topics that absorb half of the letters are social
                relations and commerce. Unfortunately, we have only partial
                names for some of the new authors who may be better identified
                as WAAMD expands and at a future date when text recognition
                technologies can be applied to their writing. Manuscripts of
                unknown authorship that have been included because they are in
                excess of 2 folios in length, number 599.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, we
                anticipate adding links to digital copies of individual
                manuscripts for all SAVAMA-DCI libraries in the future through
                the HMML Virtual Reading Room. At present (2019), only 1400 of
                the manuscripts in the Timbuktu ABS library can be viewed
                through a link in the last field in the WAAMD records, "Online
                copy url:"
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                "Collection" citations in all Timbuktu SAVAMA-DCI libraries
                refer to their original cataloguing numbers that will be
                identical to the HMML digital record numbers for each manuscript
                when these become available. In addition, each WAAMD record is
                assigned a record number (WAAMD ID#) and each author has a
                unique identification number (Author WAAMD ID#). The WAAMD
                search engine is responsive to any of these reference numbers.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD were originally developed for
                the Boutilimit and Nouakchott collections, and will make sense
                to students of the Islamic sciences. As noted in the WAAMD site
                tab that describes subject classification in detail, content
                designation for a record can vary widely, in part due to the
                differing systems of classifying subjects in the catalogues
                adapted to WAAMD fields. For example, some SAVAMA-DCI subject
                classifications favor the qualitative value of works over their
                content; in this inventory some subjects were identified as
                الفوائد ‘beneficial’ or المنافع , or as فضائل ‘of virtue’, or
                الخواص ‘special/particular value’ (frequently in the esoteric
                sciences). At least one-quarter of the descriptions of works in
                inventory records were of qualitative rather than content focus,
                outside typical descriptors used in the Islamic disciplines. Yet
                their titles indicate they deal with specific sura, discrete
                branches of the esoteric sciences, specific types of devotions,
                conduct, ethics, elements of belief, etc. Where key words in
                titles have made it possible, more precise subject
                identification for these records has been entered in WAAMD, but
                this has corrupted those qualitative subject designations
                entered in the field. Researchers may wish to consult with the
                original subject designation assigned in the field, available on
                the spreadsheets at the CSMC/SAVAMA site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject matter for correspondence presents special problems
                that were solved, where the content was discernable from a title
                or by the cataloguer in the field, by grouping letters into
                three broad, not unambiguous rubrics: politics, economy and
                social matters. The other rubric used in WAAMD that does not
                come out of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional”
                (تحنث) to encompass the large body of Prophetic love literature,
                invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer, supplication,
                etc. Many of these topics also appear as sub-headings under
                Belief, Esoteric sciences, Prophet Muhammad or Sufism.
            </p>

            <p>
                As explained in the “SUBJECT HEADINGS” tab, the same or similar
                material may appear under more than one broad rubric, following
                the best judgment of different catalogers. Thus, in subject
                searches, when specific topics are sought, readers may find it
                more productive to search for keywords in titles.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File begun in
                2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>, familiar names
                (“known as”) and standard author names. Across Islamic cultures
                in West Africa the same author may be known by several names or
                name variants (as well as by variant spellings in Arabic). In
                any author search, the AMMS search engine also surveys alternate
                names. Better-known and ‘classical’ author names that are part
                of the Library of Congress name authority file are entered in
                that form in the author records, but these may not be the names
                by which individual authors are best known in West Africa. As
                more detail is collected about individual authors and works,
                this process of refining and standardizing names will continue.
                One consequence of refining name entries is that some names in
                the database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where
                changes have been made every effort has been made to retain
                elements of the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter
                local variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. In some
                cases, in the Timbuktu ASAL collection, a title clearly appears
                to have been misattributed to another author; where author
                attribution has been changed, the original citation from
                cataloguers in the field has been retained in the miscellaneous
                field for the record (and can be retrieved in searches). Due to
                the large number of non-Arabized names in correspondence in this
                library, the transliteration of short vowels relied entirely on
                the French transliteration that accompanied the Arabic
                inventory, although these were not uniformly consistent.
