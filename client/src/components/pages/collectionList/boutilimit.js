            <h3>The Collection</h3>
            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the Boutilimit collection come from
                the private library amassed by Haroun ould Sidiyya Baba
                (1917-1978) who had spent the last thirty years of his life
                reconstituting the library and letters of his great-grandfather,
                the Moorish savant Shaykh Sidiyya (d.1868) as well as his wider
                family’s literary record (from Sidiyya’s mentors in Timbuktu
                (Sidi al-Mukhtar al-Kunti and his son Sidi Muhammad), Sidiyya’s
                son, Sidi Muhammad (d.1869), and his son, Sidiyya Baba (d.1926).
            </p>
            <p>
                At his death Haroun left over 100,000 folios of manuscript
                material that was microfilmed and catalogued in 1987/8 (the
                beginning of the AMMS project). The description of that process
                can be found in the introduction to the catalogue as well as
                several journal articles that focused on the construction of our
                bilingual, computer-based finding aid.

            <h3>Contents</h3>

                The significance of this collection lies, first, in its very
                breadth – roughly 100 years of book collecting (ca. 1810-1910),
                interspaced with letters and treatises from and about Shaykh
                Sidiyya, his son, grandson and two of his great-grandsons. This
                representative work of four generations of scholars within the
                same family includes 700-odd pieces of their correspondence, in
                addition to the literary works they consulted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, this four-generation ‘slice’ of intellectual life is
                linked to one of West Africa’s premier scholarly lineages, the
                Kunta savants in the Timbuktu region where Shaykh Sidiyya
                studied for twelve years (1810-23), and includes over 130
                letters Sidiyya copied from his Kunta mentors.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                One copy of the film is available for consultation at the
                University of Illinois Library Archives, under “C.C. Stewart
                Collection”; two other copies of the film were returned to
                Mauritania in the care of Baba Ould Haroun, custodian of his
                father’s collection, for deposit in an appropriate national
                repository. The originals of these manuscripts remain in
                Boutilimit in the care of Baba Ould Haroun. The University of
                Illinois film was digitized in 2017; for access to digital
                images contact Professor Laila Hussein Moustafa, University
                Library lhoussei@illinois.edu.

            <h3>WAAMD References</h3>
            <p>
                WAAMD assigns serial entry numbers that appear as the individual
                record number; citations to the item’s actual collection
                location appear as the “Collection #” referring to the original
                reel and film location on that reel. Each reel is made up of 20
                strips of 36-exposure film spliced together. Citations in AMMS
                refer to the reel and the spliced film, thus a citation “23/16”
                refers to reel 23 and the 16th strip of spliced film on that
                reel; a filmed ‘target’ for each manuscript identifies the item
                on the film within that 23/16 location.
            </p>
            <p>
                A manuscript that begins at reel 63, film 18 and continues
                through to the 5th film of reel 64 would be noted as
                “63/18-64/5.” All filming was conducted under natural light and
                without the intrusion of sophisticated technology resulting in
                the re-filming of about 5% of the first 86 reels; re-filmed
                items are noted in the catalogue. It is unlikely that the
                original collection remains today in the same order in which it
                was preserved following the microfilming that followed the
                sequence of filming.
            </p>
            <h3>Subject Rubrics</h3>
            <p>
                The range of subject headings used in this finding aid marked
                the beginning of a process of refinement that continued with the
                Nouakchott collection and has, imperfectly, been applied to
                other collections entered in WAAMD. It is neither comprehensive
                nor definitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature that encompasses the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Most of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.
            </p>
            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining name entries is that some names in the database may
                vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes have been
                made every effort has been made to retain elements of the
                original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local variants
                of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally, a title
                appears to have been misattributed to another author; where
                author attribution has been altered, the original citation from
                cataloguers in the field has been retained in the miscellaneous
                field, and can be retrieved by a “any field” search.
