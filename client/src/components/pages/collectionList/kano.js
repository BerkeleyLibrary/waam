            <h3>The collection</h3>

            <p>
                The manuscripts that are listed under “Kano” are drawn from
                three collections housed at the Africana Library at Northwestern
                University that were entered in the WAAMD by staff there in
                1990/91. While they are not exclusively drawn from Kano, they
                are indicative of Northern Nigeria’s rich literary heritage.
                WAAMD # 2055-2614 come from the Paden Collection, manuscripts
                acquired by John Paden for Northwestern in the 1970s; WAAMD
                entries # 2615-5948, labeled “Falke” come from the ‘Umar Falke
                library and are mainly manuscripts, also acquired by
                Northwestern in the 1970s; and WAAMD entries #2949 – 6263,
                identified as “Hunwick” from Professor John Hunwick’s
                collection, mainly market editions and locally published work.

            <h3>Contents</h3>

            <p>
                The “Kano” collections have been surveyed in two articles:
                Abdullahi Mohammed and Richard Hay, Jr., “Analysis of a West
                African Library: the Falke Collection” in Benjamin Mittman,{' '}
                <i>Personalized Data Base Systems</i> (New York, 1975) 77-96;
                and the Paden collection is reviewed by E. Saad,{' '}
                <i>History in Africa</i>, 7, 1980, 369-72. By comparison to the
                compilations of manuscripts from national collections that
                appear in WAAMD and which feature heavy concentrations of
                classical texts, the Paden and Falke private libraries tend to
                privilege contemporary, twentieth-century material heavily
                influenced by writings associated with the Tijaniyya tarīqa.
                Saad estimated that about one-half of the Paden accessions were
                privately printed pamphlets and books from Kano, Zaria and
                Cairo. Like the private library that makes up the Boutilimit
                collection, the Falke entries hold special interest as the
                collection of an individual bibliophile. The ‘Kano’ collections
                include a somewhat larger number of fragments and partial texts
                (47% are by ‘unknown author’) that contrast to the previous
                entries in WAAMD that typically contain only up to one-quarter
                of unknown authorship.

            <h3>Access</h3>

            <p>
                The Kano collections are available at the Africana Library of
                Northwestern University, Evanston, Il.
            </p>

            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>
            <p>
                Citations to the actual manuscripts appear under “collection
                number” for the individual entries where the separate “Paden”,
                “Falke”, and “Hunwick” collections are also annotated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collection numbers indicate, by suffix, records that refer to
                manuscripts (MS), locally printed market editions (ME),
                published editions (PE), and Xerox copies of one of these, noted
                as MSX, MEX, and PEX.
            </p>

            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>

            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
