            <h1>The “Shinqit” and “Wadan” records</h1>
            <h3>The Collection</h3>
            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the “Shinqit” and “Wadan”
                collections were entered in the WAAMD in 2008 from the catalogue
                published by al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation in 1997,
                series 7, edited by Ahmad wuld M. Yahya,{' '}
                <i>Handlist of manuscripts in Wadan and Shinqit</i>. In all,
                1109 manuscript records appear in the catalogue drawn from the
                following private libraries in these cities:
                <br />
                In Shinqit: <br />
                The Ahl Habt Library (630 records)<br />
                The Ahl Ahmad Sharif Library (94 records)<br />
                The Ahl Hamman Library (87 records)<br />
                The Ahl `Abd al-Hamayid Library (69 records)<br />
                The Ahl ‘Uda Library (68 records)<br />
                The Ahl al-Sabt Library (15 records)<br />
                In Wadan:<br />
                The Ahl Muhammad b. al-Hajj Library (37 records)<br />
                The Ahl al-Kitab Library (37 records)<br />
                The Ahl Dahi Library (32 records)<br />
                The Ahl `Ayydi Library (17 records)<br />
                The Ahl Yayi Bawi Library (11 records)<br />
                The Ahl Ahmad al-Sharif Library (10 records)<br />
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                These collections may be considered typical of the major works
                found in private libraries in the Shinqit region, although the
                Ahl Habt Library is clearly one of the major Mauritanian
                manuscript libraries. Unlike other private collections in the
                WAAMD, no personal correspondence or ephemera is included.
            </p>

            <h3>WAAMD References</h3>
            <p>
                WAAMD record numbers appear as they do in the published
                catalogue, identified by the grouping of these individual
                collections into the towns of their origin.
            </p>

            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections. The al-Furqan assignment of subjects
                conforms to a similar system and have only occasionally been
                described in more detail in these notices than in the original
                catalogue (following information gleaned from the work’s title).
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names</h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
