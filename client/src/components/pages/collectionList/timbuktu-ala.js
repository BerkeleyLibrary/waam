                <strong>The Almoustapha Abdoulahi Library</strong> inventory
                lists 14,442 items. SAVAMA-DCI inventories encompass all written
                material found in the library, providing a thorough accounting
                of these private libraries. This dramatically inflates the
                number of “manuscripts” in collections, since it includes large
                numbers of brief notes by unknown writers. To illustrate: in the
                (non-SAVAMA) Boutilimit library of 2051 records, 10% are by
                unknown authors; in the original (1991) handlist of accessions
                from private libraries that then made up the national collection
                of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu, 17% of the authors were unknown.
                Small, incomplete fragments of works and one and two folio
                devotional pieces by unknown authors were largely ignored in
                cataloguing these collections. By contrast, in{' '}
                <strong>the Almoustapha Abdoulahi Library</strong> inventory 97%
                (13,973 of the total manuscripts) are by unknown authors.
                Further, 97% (13,614) of the works by unknown authors are one or
                two folios in length. Only 415 of the one and two folio items
                are identified by an author or, in correspondence, by their
                recipient. This large number of works lacking in searchable data
                points presents a challenge to bibliographers and researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                WAAMD records include all items in SAVAMA-DCI inventories that
                contain at least three of the following searchable elements:
                author name, author nisba, familiar names (“known as”),
                recipients’ names (mainly in correspondence), secondary authors,
                titles and subject matter, and all items that exceed two folios
                in length. In the <strong>Almoustapha Abdoulahi Library</strong>,
                682 records meet these criteria. For the 13,614 one and
                two-folio items that lack searchable information, researchers
                are invited to consult the original inventory, sorted by
                attributed titles (generally the most descriptive part of their
                entries) at the link noted{' '}
                <a href="/files/timbuktu-ala/Timbuktu-ALA-1-2-folio.xlsx">
                    HERE <i className="fas fa-download" />{' '}
                </a>{' '}
                . As additional, searchable information is gleaned from these
                entries we will be adding them to the WAAMD database.
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The works by authors from the ‘classical’ canon in the{' '}
                <strong>Almoustapha Abdoulahi Library</strong> are typical of
                what is found in other SAVAMA-DCI collections. Additionally,
                there are 132 authors who are new to WAAMD, 107 of them from a
                large collection of correspondence. The two topics that absorb
                half of the letters are social relations and commerce.
                Unfortunately, we have only partial names for some of the new
                authors who may be better identified as WAAMD expands and at a
                future date when text recognition technologies can be applied to
                their writing. Manuscripts of unknown authorship that have been
                included because they are in excess of 2 folios in length,
                number 362.
            </p>

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, links to
                digital copies of individual manuscripts at the HMML Virtual
                Reading Room will appear in records as these become available.
                Currently about 1400 of the URL addresses for Timbuktu ALA
                records are linked in their WAAMD citations. The home HMML site
                can be reached at http://hmml.org/
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations in Timbuktu ALA records refer to the original
                cataloguing numbers that are identical to the HMML digital
                record numbers for each manuscript.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD were originally developed for
                the Boutilimit and Nouakchott collections, and will make sense
                to students of the Islamic sciences. As noted in the WAAMD site
                tab that describes subject classification in detail, content
                designation for a record can vary widely, in part due to the
                differing systems of classifying subjects in the catalogues
                adapted to WAAMD fields. For example, some SAVAMA-DCI subject
                classifications favor the qualitative value of works over their
                content; in the Timbuktu ABA inventory some subjects are
                identified as فوائد ‘beneficial’ or المنافع , or as فضائل ‘of
                virtue’, or الخواص ‘special/particular value’ (frequently in the
                esoteric sciences). At least one-quarter of the descriptions of
                works in inventory records are of qualitative rather than
                content focus. Yet their titles indicate they deal with specific
                sura, discrete branches of the esoteric sciences, specific types
                of devotions, conduct, ethics, elements of belief, etc. Where
                key words in titles have made it possible, more precise subject
                identification for these records has been entered in WAAMD, but
                this has corrupted those qualitative subject designations
                entered in the field. Researchers may wish to consult the
                original subject designation assigned in the field, available on
                the spreadsheets at the CSMC/SAVAMA site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject matter for correspondence presents special problems
                that were solved, where the content was discernable from a title
                or by the cataloguer in the field, by using three broad, not
                unambiguous rubrics for letters: politics, economy and social
                matters. The other rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional” (تحنث) to
                encompass the large body of Prophetic love literature,
                invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer, supplication,
                etc. Items on these subjects may also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, Esoteric sciences, Prophet Muhammad or Sufism.
            </p>

            <p>
                As explained in the “SUBJECT HEADINGS” tab, the same or similar
                material may appear under more than one broad rubric, following
                the best judgment of different catalogers. Thus, in subject
                searches, when specific topics are sought, readers may find it
                more productive to search for keywords in titles.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File begun in
                2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>, familiar names
                (“known as”) and standard author names. Across Islamic cultures
                in West Africa the same author may be known by several names or
                name variants (as well as by variant spellings in Arabic). In
                any author search, the AMMS search engine also surveys alternate
                names. Better-known and ‘classical’ author names that are part
                of the Library of Congress name authority file are entered in
                that form in the author records, but these may not be the names
                by which the same authors are best known in West Africa. As more
                detail is collected about individual authors and works, this
                process of refining and standardizing names will continue. One
                consequence of standardizing name entries is that some names in
                the database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where
                changes have been made every effort has been made to retain
                elements of the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter
                local variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. In
                cases when a title clearly appears to have been misattributed to
                another author, if the author attribution has been changed, the
                original citation from cataloguers in the field has been
                retained in the miscellaneous field for the record (and can be
                retrieved in searches). Transliteration of short vowels in
                non-Arabized names in correspondence in the SAVAMA-DCI libraries
                has relied entirely on French transliterations that accompany
                most Arabic inventories, although these are not uniformly
                consistent. At the time of adding this library to WAAMD
                (12/2019) the inventories’ transliterations were not complete;
                non-Arabized names will be edited to bring them into conformity
                with the French transliterations when they become available.
