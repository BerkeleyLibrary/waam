            <h3>The Collection</h3>

            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the “Ibadan” collection were
                entered in the AMMS database in 2008 from the catalogue
                published by al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation in 2000,
                edited by Baba Yunus Muhammad,
                <i>Handlist of manuscripts in the University of Ibadan</i>. In
                all, 422 manuscript records appear in that catalogue largely
                drawn from Northern Nigeria. The University of Ibadan Centre for
                Arabic Documentation collection, under the direction of John
                Hunwick, was one of the first systematic efforts in that country
                to compile and document Arabic-script materials. A large part of
                this collection is replicated in other Nigerian institutions.
                Much of the film, originally collected to preserve copies of
                these manuscripts, has deteriorated in recent years, and it is
                uncertain how much of this collection is now accessible.
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>

            <p>
                This collection was originally conceived as a repository of
                writing by Nigerian authors, although it does contain a number
                of classical works recovered from elsewhere in Nigeria.
            </p>

            <h3>WAAMD References</h3>
            <p>
                WAAMD record numbers appear as they do in the published
                catalogue.
            </p>

            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections. The al-Furqan assignment of subjects
                conforms to a similar system and have only occasionally been
                described in greater detail in these notices than in the
                original catalogue (following information gleaned from the
                work’s title).
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>

            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
