            <h3>The Collection</h3>

            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the “Kaduna” collection will be
                entered in the AMMS database in 2009 from the catalogue
                published by al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation in 1995 (vol.
                I) and 1997 (vol. II), publication # 13, edited by Baba Yunus
                Muhammad, Handlists of Islamic Manuscripts, Nigeria: The
                Nigerian National Archives, Kaduna State (2 vols.). In all, 1645
                manuscript records appear in these catalogues drawn from across
                northern Nigeria.
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>

            <p>
                This collection may be among the richest for works on and by the
                leaders of the jihad in nineteenth century Northern Nigeria,
                although it contains a good cross-section of classical works
                that made up the studies of the literati of the region.{' '}
            </p>

            <h3>AMMS References</h3>
            <p>
                AMMS record numbers appear as they do in the published
                catalogue.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject Rubrics</h3>
            <p>
                Subject headings used in AMMS represent an effort to uniformly
                apply the subject headings developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections, but where the subject headings were
                available in the al-Furqan catalogue, these were accepted for
                the purpose of AMMS listing. These subject rubrics are neither
                comprehensive nor definitive. An effort was made to arrive at
                classifications that would make sense to a student of the
                Islamic sciences and to be consistent across English and Arabic
                entries, but in a few cases there may be slight variance across
                these fields.{' '}
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>

            <p>
                All AMMS database author names were reviewed and a Name
                Authority File was established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works
                by nisba, familiar names and standard author names. As more
                detail is collected about individual works this process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One by-product
                of this process is that some names in the database may vary from
                the original cataloguing. Where changes have been made every
                effort has been made to retain elements of the original
                citations, and, if in doubt, to repeat local variants of author
                names.
