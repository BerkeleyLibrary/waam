            <h3>The collection</h3>
            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the Niamey collection were recorded
                in the WAAMD in 1990/91 from the mimeographed catalogue prepared
                in 1979 by the Institut de Recherche en Sciences Humaines (List
                des manuscripts en langues arabe et ajami à l’Institut de
                Recherche en Sciences Humaines, [IRSH] Niamey, Niger, Niamey,
                1979). This was a minimally detailed source that presented a
                number of problems that are no doubt still evident in the WAAMD
                listing. Since entering this hand-list al-Furqan Foundation
                published an inventory of the entire IRSH collection edited by
                Hasanne Mouleye in 2004 which will be entered in WAAMD by early
                2019 and replace this data.

                This collection is drawn from regions to the north-west of
                Niamey (the Azaouad) across modern-day northern Nigeria, and, to
                the north, Ahir/Aïr, and it provides a link between material
                collected at Timbuktu and that identified as “Kano” in WAAMD.
                All 2551 entries in the mimeo 1979 hand-list are entered in
                WAAMD, but a number of these are only partially identified due
                to the incomplete information in that listing. Currently, the
                Institut in Niamey possesses over 4,000 manuscripts in its
                collection.

                The Niamey collection was begun by the then President of the
                Niger Assemblée Nationale, Boubou Hama, in the early 1970s as a
                personal collection as a part of his research and writing on the
                region. A survey of what had become the IRSH collection was
                published in 1980 (Ahmed Mohammed Kani, “A New Source for
                Material on the Literary Activity of the ‘ulama of the central
                and western Sudan: the Niamey collection” in{' '}
                <i>Bulletin of Information, Fontes Historiae Africanae</i>,
                Evanston, 1984/5, 41-48), and in 1996 the collection description
                was up-dated by M. Ayman Fadel in <i>Sudanic Africa</i> (7,
                1996, 165-169).

                It includes some photocopies of original material that appears
                elsewhere, but annotations do not indicate provenance of
                individual entries, and it contains a handful of non-Arabic
                materials (conscientiously given Arabic titles). It appears to
                be especially rich in nineteenth-century correspondence, but
                what part of this consists of original manuscripts, and what
                part are xerox copies is not clear.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                The Niamey collection is open to researchers at the IRSH,
                Niamey.

            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>
            <p>
                Citations to the hand-list numbers appear under “collection
                number” in the individual records. Since the published catalogue
                was produced in Arabic, we have reproduced the entries
                (inclusive of some errors) and added full names and nisbas where
                this information is available from other citations to the same
                authors in WAAMD. No effort has been made to coordinate the
                hand-list citations with the 2004 published catalogue.
            </p>
            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections, following information gleaned from the
                work’s title.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.

            <h3>Author Names </h3>

            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
