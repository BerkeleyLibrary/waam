            <h3>The collection</h3>

            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the Nouakchott collection were
                recorded in the WAAMD in 1988/89 from the hand-list of the
                national repository for Arabic manuscripts at the Institut
                Mauritanien de Recherche Scientifique (IMRS) in Nouakchott . The
                IMRS began purchasing Mauritanian libraries and individual
                manuscripts in 1975 and by the late 1980s it had acquired the
                3134 items listed here. A separate project at IMRS focused on
                the preservation of poetry is not included in this list that
                primarily focuses on major literary works rather than ephemera
                (correspondence, individual legal decisions, etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
                The manuscripts in this collection bear comparison to two other
                hand-lists of Mauritanian work by Mokhtar ould Hamidoun and Adam
                Heymowski in 1964/5 and Ulrich Rebstock’s microfilmed selection
                of 2239 manuscripts (including over 600 from the IMRS
                collection) in 1985.
            </p>
            <p>
                The definitive (to date) inventory of Mauritanian writing
                appeared in 2015 and it has been taken as authoritative in the
                listing of authors and works that make up the IMRS collection.
                See “ALA V” for a summary of that volume, now a part of the
                WAAMD.

            <h3>Contents</h3>

            <p>
                In 1991 the IMRS collection was made up of manuscripts from 72
                libraries, mainly from the region of Trarza in the southwest
                quadrant of the country and with a focus on manuscripts of local
                authorship. The WAAMD records include a number of items (493)
                that had not been identified at that time, but the number of
                multiple copies in this collection point to the possibility that
                the contents may be broadly representative of scholarly activity
                in the region north of the right bank of the Senegal River.

            <h3>Access</h3>

            <p>
                The IMRS provides access to its collection by bone fide
                researchers who make application through the Bibliothèque
                Nationale in Nouakchott.
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations to the actual IMRS manuscript identifying numbers
                appear under “collection number” in the individual records.
                Hassaniyya phonetics in personal names and place names, were
                generally resolved in favor of an Arabized version of the
                Hassaniyya name.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the use of Latin characters did permit an insertion of
                a pronunciation help where Hassaniyya letters had no equivalent
                in Arabic.
            </p>

            <h3>Subjects</h3>

            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.

            <h3>Author Names</h3>

            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search. Author names originating from the Brill, ALA V volumes
                contain Hassaniyya variants to classical Arabic form.
