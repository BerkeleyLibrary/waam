                Records from the `Abd al-Mu’min (Zawiya al-Kunti) Library in
                Timbuktu (“Timbuktu AZK”) have been provided by The Centre for
                the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC), University of Hamburg,
                in collaboration with a consortium of private libraries,
                Sauvegarde et Valorisation des Manuscrits pour la Défense de la
                Culture Islamique, in Timbuktu, Mali, (SAVAMA-DCI) and the Hill
                Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML), St. John’s University, St.
                Cloud Minnesota. HMML is digitizing manuscripts transferred from
                Timbuktu to Bamako in 2013, and this is the second of the 22
                private libraries in Timbuktu that are scheduled to be entered
                in WAAMD.{' '}

            <p>
                <strong>The `Abd al-Mu’min (Zawiya al-Kunti) Library</strong>{' '}
                consists of 9,873 items. SAVAMA-DCI inventories encompass all
                written material found in the library, providing a thorough
                accounting of these private libraries. This dramatically
                inflates the number of “manuscripts” in collections, since it
                includes large numbers of brief notes by unknown writers. To
                illustrate: in the (non-SAVAMA) Boutilimit library of 2051
                records, 10% are by unknown authors; in the original (1991)
                handlist of accessions from private libraries that then made up
                the national collection of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu, 17% of
                the authors were unknown. Small, incomplete fragments of works
                and one and two folio devotional pieces by unknown authors were
                largely ignored in cataloguing these collections. By contrast,
                in <strong>the `Abd al-Mu’min (Zawiya al-Kunti) Library</strong>{' '}
                inventory 96% (9,478 of the total manuscripts) are by unknown
                authors. Further, 84% (8,299) of the works by unknown authors
                are one or two folios in length. Only a small number of the one
                and two folio items are identified by an author or, in
                correspondence, by their recipient. This large number of works
                lacking in searchable data points presents a challenge to
                bibliographers and researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                WAAMD records include all items in SAVAMA-DCI inventories that
                contain at least three of the following searchable elements:
                author name, author nisba, familiar names (“known as”),
                recipients’ names (mainly in correspondence), secondary authors,
                titles and subject matter, and all items that exceed two folios
                in length. In the{' '}
                <strong>`Abd al-Mu’min (Zawiya al-Kunti) Library</strong>, 2,688
                records meet these criteria. For the 8,299 one and two-folio
                items that lack searchable information, researchers are invited
                to consult the original inventory, sorted by attributed titles
                (generally the most descriptive part of their entries) at the
                link noted{' '}
                <a href="/files/timbuktu-azk/timbuktu-AZK-1-2-folio-items.xlsx">
                    HERE <i className="fas fa-download" />{' '}
                </a>. As additional, searchable information is gleaned from
                these entries we will be adding them to the WAAMD database.
            </p>
            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The works by identified authors in the{' '}
                <strong>`Abd al-Mu’min (Zawiya al-Kunti) Library</strong> are
                typical of the contents in other WAAMD family library records;
                52% (253) of the items with identified authors are new authors
                (who do not appear in WAAMD, or do not appear in the form
                provided in this inventory). Unfortunately, we have only partial
                names for some of the new authors who may be better identified
                as WAAMD expands and at a future date when text recognition
                technologies can be applied to their writing. Manuscripts of
                unknown authorship that have been included because they are in
                excess of 2 folios in length, number 1,110.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, links to
                digital copies of individual manuscripts in Timbuktu AZK at the
                HMML Virtual Reading Room will be noted in records when these
                become available. The home HMML site can be reached at
                http://hmml.org/
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations in Timbuktu AZK records refer to the original
                cataloguing numbers that are identical to the HMML digital
                records numbers for each manuscript.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections, but in cases where only a minimal level
                of detail was annotated in the field inventories, subject
                headings have been reconstructed from keywords in titles where
                these are available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries, but there may occasionally be slight variance
                across these fields. The subject matter for correspondence
                presents special problems that were solved, where the content
                was discernable from a title or by the annotator in the field,
                by grouping correspondence into three broad, not unambiguous
                rubrics: politics, economy and society. The other rubric used in
                WAAMD that does not come out of the Islamic disciplines is that
                of “devotional’ ( تحنث ) to encompass the large body of
                Prophetic love literature, invocations, intercession,
                exhortation, prayer, supplication, etc. Most of these also
                appear as sub-headings under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or
                Sufism.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original Timbuktu AZK inventory employed a range of subject
                headings not entirely consistent with the other WAAMD records,
                and, where possible, they have been altered to conform to
                existing subject rubrics. As explained in the drop-down “SUBJECT
                HEADINGS,” the same or similar material may appear under more
                than one broad rubric, following the best judgment of different
                catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by nisba, familiar
                names and standard author names. Currently, the Library of
                Congress name authority file is being added to WAAMD records,
                and as more detail is collected about individual works is added
                this process of refining and standardizing names will continue.
                One consequence of refining name entries is that some names in
                the database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where
                changes have been made every effort has been made to retain
                elements of the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter
                local variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. In some
                cases, in the Timbuktu AZK collection, a title clearly was
                misattributed to another author; where author attribution has
                been changed, the original citation from cataloguers in the
                field has been retained in the miscellaneous field for the
                record.
