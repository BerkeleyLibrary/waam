            <p>
                Records from the Abu Bakr b. Sa’id Library in Timbuktu
                (“Timbuktu ABS”) have been provided by The Centre for the Study
                of Manuscript Cultures, University of Hamburg (CSMC), in
                collaboration with a consortium of private libraries, Sauvegarde
                et Valorisation des Manuscrits pour la Défense de la Culture
                Islamique, in Timbuktu, Mali, (SAVAMA-DCI) and the Hill Museum
                and Manuscript Library (HMML), St. John’s University, St. Cloud
                Minnesota. HMML is preserving and digitizing manuscripts
                transferred from Timbuktu to Bamako in 2013, and this is the
                first of the contents of 22 private libraries in Timbuktu that
                are planned to be entered in WAAMD.{' '}

            <p>
                <strong>The Abu Bakr b. Sa’id Library</strong> consists of 7610
                items and it was the first set of SAVAMA-DCI records to be
                entered in WAAMD as well as the first to include links to
                digital images of mss (in the HMML Virtual Reading Room). As a
                collection, it differs from most of the original libraries that
                make up the WAAMD in one major respect: prior libraries largely
                excluded ephemeral material for which authorship could not be
                attributed. By contrast, the Timbuktu ABS entries faithfully
                include all written material found in the library. This provides
                a more thorough understanding of the total contents of a private
                library and at the same time somewhat inflates the number of
                “manuscripts” recorded. To illustrate: in the Boutilimit library
                of 2051 records, 10% were with unknown author; in the original
                handlist (1991) of accessions from private libraries that then
                made up the national collection of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu,
                17% of the authors were unknown. Small, incomplete fragments of
                works and one and two folio devotional pieces by unknown authors
                were largely ignored in cataloguing these collections. By
                contrast, in <strong>the Abu Bakr b. Sa’id Library</strong>{' '}
                inventory 82% (6,240 of the total manuscripts) are by known
                authors. Further, 32% (2,435) of the works by unknown authors
                are one or two folios in length. In brief, the Timbuktu ABS
                records will provide a very accurate picture of the total
                contents of a private library, albeit authors can only be
                identified for 18% of the manuscripts. This large number of
                works lacking in searchable data points presents a challenge to
                bibliographers and researchers. In all the other SAVAMA-DCI
                libraries the one and two folio documents lacking in searchable
                information have not been entered in WAAMD, but they can be
                found in their original spreadsheet form at a link on their
                collection page.
            </p>
            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The contents of identified authors in Timbuktu ABS are typical
                of works found in other WAAMD family library records; 12% (179)
                of the records are ‘new’ authors (who did not previously appear
                in WAAMD). Unfortunately, at least half of the new authors are
                only partial names with attributed titles that may never be
                identified. One feature of the Timbuktu ABS collection that
                stands in contrast to other private libraries are the multiple
                copies of individual authors’ works that, in some cases, exceed
                the total number of those works by those authors in the entire
                WAAMD. This may be an artifact of cataloguing in the field or
                the legacy of a copying business at the library, but it stands
                in such contrast with previous collections that it deserves
                attention.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, links to
                digital copies of individual manuscripts at the HMML Virtual
                Reading Room are in records where these are available. Currently
                about 1400 of the Timbuktu ABS records can be viewed. The home
                HMML site can be reached at http://hmml.org/
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations in Timbuktu ABS records refer to the original
                cataloguing numbers that are identical to the HMML digital
                records numbers for each manuscript.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAMMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections, but in cases where there is a minimal
                level of detail annotated, the subject headings have been
                reconstructed from keywords in titles where these are available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries, but there may occasionally be slight variance
                across these fields. The subject matter for correspondence
                presents special problems that were solved, where the content
                was discernable from a title or by the annotator in the field,
                by grouping letters into three broad, not unambiguous rubrics:
                politics, economy and society. The other rubric used in WAAMD
                that does not come out of the Islamic disciplines is that of
                “devotional’ ( تحنث ) to encompass the large body of Prophetic
                love literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Most of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original Timbuktu ABS inventory employed a range of subject
                headings not entirely consistent with the other WAAMD records,
                and, where possible, they have been altered to conform to
                existing subject rubrics. As explained in the drop-down “SUBJECT
                HEADINGS,” the same or similar material may appear under more
                than one broad rubric, following the best judgment of different
                catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAMMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail is collected about individual works this process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One result of
                this process is that some names in the database may vary from
                their original cataloguing. Where changes have been made every
                effort has been made to retain elements of the original
                citations, and, when in doubt, to repeat local variants of
                author names. In some cases, in the Timbuktu ABS collection, a
                title clearly was misattributed to another author; where author
                attribution has been changed, the original citation from
                cataloguers in the field has been retained (and can be searched)
                in the miscellaneous field for the record.
