                Records from the <strong>Infa Yatara Library</strong> in
                Timbuktu (“Timbuktu IY”) have been provided by The Centre for
                the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC), University of Hamburg,
                in collaboration with a consortium of private libraries,
                Sauvegarde et Valorisation des Manuscrits pour la Défense de la
                Culture Islamique, in Timbuktu, Mali, (SAVAMA-DCI) and the Hill

                focuses on digitizing manuscripts transferred from Timbuktu to
                Bamako in 2013. Nock Yattara was the cataloguer in the field who
                compiled the inventory.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The Infa Yatara Library</strong> inventory lists 3,796
                items. SAVAMA-DCI inventories encompass all written material
                found in the library, providing a thorough accounting of these
                private libraries. This dramatically inflates the number of
                “manuscripts” in collections, since it includes large numbers of
                brief notes by unknown writers. To illustrate: in the
                (non-SAVAMA) Boutilimit library of 2051 records, 10% are by
                unknown authors; in the original (1991) handlist of accessions
                from private libraries that then made up the national collection
                of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu, 17% of the authors were unknown.
                Small, incomplete fragments of works and one and two folio
                devotional pieces by unknown authors were largely ignored in
                cataloguing these collections. By contrast, in{' '}
                <strong>the Infa Yatara Library</strong> inventory 84% (3,185 of
                the total manuscripts) are by unknown authors. Further, 69%
                (2,183) of the works by unknown authors are one or two folios in
                length. Only 5% (115) of the one and two folio items are
                identified by an author or, in correspondence, by their
                recipient. This large number of works lacking in searchable data
                points presents a challenge to bibliographers and researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                WAAMD records include all items in SAVAMA-DCI inventories that
                contain at least three of the following searchable elements:
                author name, author nisba, familiar names (“known as”),
                recipients’ names (mainly in correspondence), secondary authors,
                titles and subject matter, and all items that exceed two folios
                in length. In the Infa Yatara Library, 1,613 records meet these
                criteria. For the 2,183 one and two-folio items that lack
                searchable information, researchers are invited to consult the
                original inventory, sorted by attributed titles (generally the
                most descriptive part of their entries) at the link noted{' '}
                <a href="/files/timbuktu-iy/Timbuktu-IY-1-2-folio.xlsx">
                    HERE <i className="fas fa-download" />{' '}
                </a>. As additional, searchable information is gleaned from
                these entries we will be adding them to the WAAMD database.
            </p>

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The works by authors from the ‘classical’ canon in the{' '}
                <strong>Infa Yatara Library</strong> are among the most
                comprehensive in comparison to what is found in other SAVAMA-DCI
                collections, and its contents read like the teaching libraries
                earlier entered in WAAMD. Additionally, there are 41 authors who
                are new to WAAMD. Unfortunately, we have only partial names for
                some of the new authors who may be better identified as WAAMD
                expands and at a future date when text recognition technologies
                can be applied to their writing. Manuscripts of unknown
                authorship that have been included because they are in excess of
                2 folios in length, number 1002.

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, links to
                digital copies of individual manuscripts at the HMML Virtual
                Reading Room will appear in records as these become available.
                Currently about 1400 of the URL addresses for Timbuktu ABS
                records are linked in their WAAMD citations. The home HMML site
                can be reached at http://hmml.org/
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations in Timbuktu IY records refer to the original
                cataloguing numbers that are identical to the HMML digital
                record numbers for each manuscript.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD were originally developed for
                the Boutilimit and Nouakchott collections, and will make sense
                to students of the Islamic sciences. As noted in the WAAMD site
                tab that describes subject classification in detail, subject
                designation for a record can vary widely, and the WA. For
                example, some SAVAMA-DCI subject classifications favor the
                qualitative value of works over their content; in the
                Timbuktu-IY inventory the subjects are identified as الفوائد
                ‘beneficial’ or المنافع ; as ‘special/particular value’ الخواص
                (generally in the esoteric sciences). Nearly half of the
                subjects in the inventory fall outside typical descriptors used
                in the Islamic disciplines, yet they deal with specific sura,
                discrete branches of the esoteric sciences, specific types of
                devotions, conduct, ethics, belief, etc. Where key words in
                titles or other WAAMD entries have made it possible, more
                precise subject identification for these records has been
                entered in WAAMD, but this has corrupted those subject
                designations entered in the field. Researchers may wish to
                consult with the original subject designation assigned in the
                field, available on the spreadsheets at the CSMC/SAVAMA site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject matter for correspondence presents special problems
                that were solved, where the content was discernable from a title
                or by the cataloguer in the field, by grouping letters into
                three broad, not unambiguous rubrics: politics, economy and
                social matters. The other rubric used in WAAMD that does not
                come out of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional”
                (تحنث) to encompass the large body of Prophetic love literature,
                invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer, supplication,
                etc. Many of these topics also appear as sub-headings under
                Belief, Esoteric sciences, Prophet Muhammad or Sufism.
            </p>

            <p>
                As explained in the “SUBJECT HEADINGS” tab, the same or similar
                material may appear under more than one broad rubric, following
                the best judgment of different catalogers. Thus, in subject
                searches, when specific topics are sought, readers may find it
                more productive to search for keywords in titles.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File begun in
                2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>, familiar names
                (“known as”) and standard author names. Across Islamic cultures
                in West Africa the same author may be known by several names or
                name variants (as well as by variant spellings in Arabic). In
                any author search, the AMMS search engine also surveys alternate
                names. Better-known and ‘classical’ author names that are part
                of the Library of Congress name authority file are entered in
                that form in the author records, but these may not be the names
                by which individual authors are best known in West Africa. As
                more detail is collected about individual authors and works,
                this process of refining and standardizing names will continue.
                One consequence of refining name entries is that some names in
                the database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where
                changes have been made every effort has been made to retain
                elements of the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter
                local variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. In some
                cases, in the Timbuktu IY collection, a title clearly appears to
                have been misattributed to another author; where author
                attribution has been changed, the original citation from
                cataloguers in the field has been retained in the miscellaneous
                field for the record (and can be retrieved in searches).
