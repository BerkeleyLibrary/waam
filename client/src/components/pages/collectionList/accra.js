            <h3>The Collection</h3>

            <p>
                The manuscripts that are listed under “Ghana” are drawn from a
                collection housed at the Africana Library at Northwestern
                University that were entered in the AMMS by staff there in 2007.
                The University of Ghana collection records 485 photocopies of
                original works collected during the 1960s at the Institute of
                African Studies under the direction of Professor Ivor Wilks.

            <h3>Contents</h3>

            <p>
                The “Ghana” collection consists of works collected from private
                libraries throughout the country, about half on the Islamic
                sciences and half consisting of king lists, correspondence and
                chronicles mainly relating to Northern Ghana. Most are in
                Arabic, many with Hausa glosses. Aside from classical works, a
                number of Ghanaian authors are represented including the
                Kete-Krachi savant al-Hajj `Umar and scholars from the Bamba and
                Saghanugu families, largely from the twentieth century.

            <h3>Access </h3>
            <p>
                The Ghana collection is available at the Africana Library of
                Northwestern University, Evanston, Il.

            <h3>WAAMD References</h3>
            <p>
                Citations to the manuscripts appear under “collection number”
                for the individual entries. independently entered in AMMS at
                Northwestern.

            <p>
                Collection numbers indicate, by suffix, records that refer to
                manuscripts (MS), locally printed market editions (ME),
                published editions (PE), and Xerox copies of one of these, noted
                as MSX, MEX, and PEX.

            <h3>Subject Rubrics</h3>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.

            <h3>Author Names </h3>

            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
