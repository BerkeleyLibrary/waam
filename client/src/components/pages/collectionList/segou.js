            <h3>The collection</h3>
            <p>
                The manuscripts that make up the Segou collection were recorded
                in the WAAMD in 1988/89 from the catalogue prepared in 1985 by
                Ghali, Mahibou and Brenner,{' '}
                <i>Inventaire de la Bibliotheque ‘Umarienne de Segou</i> (CNRS,
                1985). The collection has been variously called the “Ahmadou
                Library” and “Fonds Archinard” (the latter after the French
                officer who seized the manuscripts at the time of conquest in
                1890).
            </p>
            <p>
                References to these manuscripts had appeared previously but
                incompletely in a 1925 catalogue of Arabic manuscripts at the
                Bibliothèque Nationale, and in a 1976 catalogue based on a
                selective inventory of the collection done in 1947-52. These
                efforts both omitted much material of interest to West African
                historians, which led to the entire collection being
                re-catalogued, and microfilmed between 1979-82; the inventory
                cited above was published three years later.

            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The Segou collection is from the library of Ahmadu Seku, son of
                al-Hajj ‘Umar, who inherited his father’s conquests and ruled a
                territory increasingly under siege from 1864 until the French
                conquest in 1890. It contains numerous fragments and single page
                items and a large and valuable body of correspondence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its disparate make-up lends it a certain air of authenticity as
                a working library, a repository of day-to-day writings not
                filtered by an owner self-conscious of his scholarly image or
                the literary capital represented by classical works. Entries in
                WAAMD are from the French catalogue, which necessitated
                translation of titles back into Arabic, aided by the working
                notes of the publication’s compilers.
            </p>
            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                The Segou collection is available at the Bibliothèque Nationale
                de Paris, Section des Manuscrits Orientaux. Xerox copies and/or
                digital images of the collection are available at Yale
                University Library, Africana Collection, and at the Centre de
                Recherche et Documentation Historiques Ahmed Baba, Timbuktu,
                Mali.
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>
            <p>
                Citations to the BN manuscript identifying numbers appear under
                “collection number” in the individual records. Since the
                published catalogue was produced in French transliteration, the
                AMMS Arabic entries required a re-translation, greatly aided by
                access to M. al-Ghali and Mahibou’s notes, kindly made available
                by Professor John Hunwick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Substantial editing has been done to bring names and spellings
                in conformity with other entries by the same authors in the
                WAAMD records, and where partially-identified authors of
                classical works were listed, these have been filled out to
                facilitate their cross-listing with other collections.
            </p>
            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD represent an effort to apply
                the subject headings originally developed for the Boutilimit and
                Nouakchott collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject rubrics will make sense to a student of the Islamic
                sciences and they are generally consistent across English and
                Arabic entries. One rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out
                of the Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional’ ( تحنث )
                literature to encompass the large body of Prophetic love
                literature, invocations, intercession, exhortation, prayer,
                supplication, etc. Some of these also appear as sub-headings
                under Belief, or Esoteric sciences or Sufism. As explained in
                the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or similar material
                may appear under more than one broad rubric, following the best
                judgment of different catalogers.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File
                established in 2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>,
                familiar names and standard author names. Currently, the Library
                of Congress name authority file is being added, and as more
                detail about individual authors comes to light the process of
                refining and standardizing names will continue. One consequence
                of refining/standardizing name entries is that some names in the
                database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where changes
                have been made every effort has been made to retain elements of
                the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter local
                variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. Occasionally,
                a title appears to have been misattributed to another author;
                where author attribution has been altered, the original citation
                from cataloguers in the field has been retained in the
                miscellaneous field, and can be retrieved by a “any field”
                search.
