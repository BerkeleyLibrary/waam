                Records from the <strong>al-Ṭāhir Mu‘ādh Library</strong> in
                Timbuktu (“Timbuktu ATM”) have been provided by The Centre for
                the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC), University of Hamburg,
                in collaboration with a consortium of private libraries,
                Sauvegarde et Valorisation des Manuscrits pour la Défense de la
                Culture Islamique, in Timbuktu, Mali, (SAVAMA-DCI) and the Hill

                focuses on digitizing manuscripts transferred from Timbuktu to
                Bamako in 2013. The al-Ṭāhir Mu‘ādh Library is the largest of
                the 22 SAVAMA-DCI libraries, all of which are scheduled to be
                entered in WAAMD. Abdoul Fattah Attaher was the staff member who
                supervised the al-Ṭāhir Mu‘ādh Library inventory.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The al-Ṭāhir Mu‘ādh Library</strong> inventory lists
                38,976 items. SAVAMA-DCI inventories encompass all written
                material found in the library, providing a thorough accounting
                of these private libraries. This dramatically inflates the
                number of “manuscripts” in collections, since it includes large
                numbers of brief notes by unknown writers. To illustrate: in the
                (non-SAVAMA) Boutilimit library of 2051 records, 10% are by
                unknown authors; in the original (1991) handlist of accessions
                from private libraries that then made up the national collection
                of Mali at IHERIAB in Timbuktu, 17% of the authors were unknown.
                Small, incomplete fragments of works and one and two folio
                devotional pieces by unknown authors were largely ignored in
                cataloguing these collections. By contrast, in{' '}
                <strong>the al-Ṭāhir Mu‘ādh Library</strong> inventory 88%
                (34,087 of the total manuscripts) are by unknown authors.
                Further, 90% (35,009) of the works by unknown authors are one or
                two folios in length. Only 3% (1,117) of the one and two folio
                items are identified by an author or, in correspondence, by
                their recipient. This large number of works lacking in
                searchable data points present a challenge to bibliographers and
                researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                WAAMD records include all items in SAVAMA-DCI inventories that
                exceed two folios in length and/or (irrespective of length) that
                contain at least three searchable elements: author name, author
                nisba, familiar names (“known as”), recipients’ names (mainly in
                correspondence), secondary authors, titles and subject matter.
                In the al-Ṭāhir Mu‘ādh Library, 4886 records meet these
                criteria. For the 34,086 one and two-folio items that lack
                searchable information, researchers are invited to consult the
                original inventory, sorted by attributed titles (generally the
                most descriptive part of their entries) at the link noted{' '}
                <a href="/files/timbuktu-atm/timbuktu-ATM-1-2-folio-items.xlsx">
                    HERE <i className="fas fa-download" />{' '}
                </a>. As additional, searchable information is gleaned from
                these entries we will be adding them to the WAAMD database.
            </p>
            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
                The 926 works by authors from the ‘classical’ canon in Timbuktu
                ATM are typical of what is found in other West African family
                libraries; additionally, there are about 825 author names that
                are new to WAAMD, 69% of them from correspondence.
                Unfortunately, we have only partial names for many of the new
                authors who may only be better identified as WAAMD expands and
                at a future date when text recognition technologies can be
                applied to their writing. Manuscripts of unknown authorship
                included because they are in excess of 2 folios in length,
                number 3105 (64% of the Timbuktu ATM sample) in WAAMD. We
                welcome information on the authorship of these works as scholars
                uncover it so that these records can be made more complete.
            </p>

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the HMML digitization project noted above, links to
                digital copies of individual manuscripts at the HMML Virtual
                Reading Room will appear in records as these become available.
                Currently about 1400 of the url addresses for Timbuktu ABS
                records are linked in their WAAMD citations. The home HMML site
                can be reached at http://hmml.org/
            </p>
            <h3>WAAMD references</h3>

            <p>
                Citations in Timbuktu ATM records refer to the original
                cataloguing numbers that are identical to the HMML digital
                record numbers for each manuscript.
            </p>

            <h3>Subject rubrics</h3>

            <p>
                The subject headings used in WAAMD were originally developed for
                the Boutilimit and Nouakchott collections, and will make sense
                to students of the Islamic sciences. Where new material has
                employed subject labels at variance from the WAAMD rubrics, its
                subject headings have been reconstructed from keywords in titles
                where these are available. For example, some SAVAMA-DCI subject
                classifications favor the qualitative value of works over their
                content; in the Timbuktu-ATM inventory the subjects for 4,525
                items are identified as ‘beneficial’ الفوائد; 4,307 as
                ‘special/particular value’ الخواص; 4,997 as ‘beneficial use’
                المنافع. Well over half of the subjects identified in that
                inventory fall outside typical descriptions of the Islamic
                disciplines, yet they deal with specific sura, discrete branches
                of the esoteric sciences, devotional material, conduct, ethics,
                belief, etc. Where keywords in titles have made it possible,
                more precise subject matter for these records has been
                identified for the WAAMD entry, but this has corrupted about
                half of the subject designations entered in the field.
                Researchers may wish to consult with the original subject
                designation assigned in the field, available on the spreadsheets
                at the CSMC/SAVAMA site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject matter for correspondence presents special problems
                that were solved, where the content was discernable from a title
                or by the annotator in the field, by grouping letters into three
                broad, not unambiguous rubrics: politics, economy and society.
                The other rubric used in WAAMD that does not come out of the
                Islamic disciplines is that of “devotional” (تحنث) to encompass
                the large body of Prophetic love literature, invocations,
                intercession, exhortation, prayer, supplication, etc. Many of
                these topics also appear as sub-headings under Belief, Esoteric
                sciences, Prophet Muhammad or Sufism.
            </p>

            <p>
                As explained in the drop-down “SUBJECT HEADINGS,” the same or
                similar material may appear under more than one broad rubric,
                following the best judgment of different catalogers. Thus, in
                subject searches, when specific topics are sought, it may be
                more productive to search for key words in titles.
            </p>

            <h3>Author Names </h3>
            <p>
                All WAAMD author names conform to a Name Authority File begun in
                2009 to aid retrieval of works by <i>nisba</i>, familiar names
                (“known as”) and standard author names. Across Islamic cultures
                in West Africa the same author may be known by several names or
                name variants (as well as by variant spellings in Arabic). In
                any author search, the AMMS search engine also surveys alternate
                names. Better-known and ‘classical’ author names that are part
                of the Library of Congress name authority file are entered in
                that form in the author records, but these may not be the names
                by which individual authors are best known in West Africa. As
                more detail is collected about individual authors and works,
                this process of refining and standardizing names will continue.
                One consequence of refining name entries is that some names in
                the database may vary from their original cataloguing. Where
                changes have been made every effort has been made to retain
                elements of the original citations, and, when in doubt, to enter
                local variants of author names in the “alt. name” field. In some
                cases, in the Timbuktu ATM collection, a title clearly appears
                to have been misattributed to another author; where author
                attribution has been changed, the original citation from
                cataloguers in the field has been retained in the miscellaneous
                field for the record (and can be retrieved in searches).
